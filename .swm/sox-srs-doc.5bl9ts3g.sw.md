\### 1. Introduction

\#### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the technical requirements for a Voice-Activated ChatGPT CLI Application. This document will serve as a reference for developers, stakeholders, and end-users involved in the development and usage of the application.

\#### 1.2 Scope

The application aims to provide a voice-activated interface for interacting with ChatGPT, enhanced with a visually appealing CLI experience using [charm.sh](http://charm.sh) libraries. The application will be developed using Python for the backend logic and Go for the CLI interface.

\#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

\- **CLI**: Command Line Interface

\- **GPT-3**: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3

\- **API**: Application Programming Interface

\- **Go**: Golang programming language

\- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product

\#### 1.4 References

\- Python Programming Language: \[Python Official Documentation\]([https://docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/))

\- GPT-3 API: \[OpenAI API Documentation\]([https://beta.openai.com/docs/](https://beta.openai.com/docs/))

\- [charm.sh](http://charm.sh): \[[charm.sh](http://charm.sh) GitHub Repository\]([https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm))

\#### 1.5 Overview

The remaining sections of this document provide a detailed description of the system's requirements, including functional, non-functional, and interface requirements.

\---

\### 2. Overall Description

\#### 2.1 Product Perspective

The application will be a standalone software package that can be installed and run on systems with Python and Go installed.

\#### 2.2 Product Functions

\- Voice recognition for converting user speech to text

\- Text-to-speech for converting GPT-3 responses to voice

\- GPT-3 API integration for chat functionality

\- CLI interface designed using [charm.sh](http://charm.sh) libraries

\- Optional feature for custom voice commands

\#### 2.3 User Characteristics

The application is intended for users who are comfortable with CLI interfaces and are interested in a voice-activated chatbot experience.

\#### 2.4 Constraints

\- Requires Python and Go to be installed on the system

\- Requires an internet connection for GPT-3 API calls

\- GPT-3 API usage may incur costs

\#### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

\- Assumes that the user has a working microphone and speaker

\- Dependent on the availability and uptime of the GPT-3 API

\---

\### 3. Specific Requirements

\#### 3.1 Functional Requirements

1\. **Voice Recognition**

\- The system should accurately convert user voice input to text.

<br/>

2\. **Text-to-Speech**

\- The system should convert GPT-3 text output to speech.

<br/>

3\. **GPT-3 Integration**

\- The system should send the text to GPT-3 and receive a response.

<br/>

4\. **CLI Design**

\- The CLI should be visually appealing with color-coded text, progress bars, and animations.

<br/>

5\. **Command Customization (Optional)**

\- Users should be able to set custom voice commands.

\#### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1\. **Usability**

\- The CLI should be user-friendly and intuitive.

<br/>

2\. **Performance**

\- The system should have minimal latency.

<br/>

3\. **Reliability**

\- Error handling for voice recognition failures or API downtimes.

\#### 3.3 Interface Requirements

\- Command Line Interface designed using [charm.sh](http://charm.sh) libraries

\- Voice interface for input and output

\#### 3.4 Performance Requirements

\- The application should respond to voice commands within 2 seconds.

\- GPT-3 API calls should be completed within 5 seconds.

\#### 3.5 Security Requirements

\- Secure storage of any API keys or sensitive information.

\#### 3.6 Quality Attributes

\- Extensibility: The design should allow for future extensions, such as additional features or integrations.

\- Maintainability: Code should be well-documented and follow best practices.
